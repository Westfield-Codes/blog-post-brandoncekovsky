      <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
      <p><em>10/17/24: by Brandon Cekovsky <a href="mailto: brandon200227@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">My Email!</a>
      <p>OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming, which is a good thing. In baking, however, OOP means that you messed up the recipe. See what I did there? Maybe? Well, writing a program is like following a recipe. (If you would just like the recipe, follow it by going to <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/">this</a> link.) I appreciate cookies and programs more, pay more attention to them, and improve my ability to make them when I understand how they are made.</p>
	  <p>But maybe you aren’t a fan of programming. Are your cookies just not quite right? Are they <em>soggy??</em> Maybe too <strong>dry</strong>? If you answered yes to these questions, keep on reading! By the end of this guide, your cookies will be better than <strong>Chips Ahoy.</strong> </p>
	  <p>This guide will walk you and your baking skills through detailed and easy-to-follow steps to make your cookies into perfection! We start with ingredients, then work our way through the process of the cookies, and maybe add some extra personality to make cookies better than your friends! We will also teach you a little about Object Oriented Programming (OOP).</p>
	  <h4><u>So, what are commands, objects, and rules?</u></h4>
	  <p><strong>Commands: </strong>They incorporate an action towards an object that cannot move on its own. Commands are instructions that the program follows to carry out a specific task. (Arguments/Parameters)</p>
	  <p><strong>Objects: </strong>Stands alone, and needs rules and commands in order to be used.</p>
      <p><strong>Rules: </strong>If broken, this triggers a response that involves consequences while on the web.
	  <p></p>
	  <h2><u>It's Recipe Time!</u></h2>
	  <p></p>
	  <h4><u>Ingredients:</u></h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>2 and 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
		<li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>3/4 cup (170g / 12 Tbsp) unsalted butter, melted & cooled 5 minutes</li>
		<li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
		<li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
		<li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks</li>
		<li>Sprinkles of your choosing (optional)</li>
		<li>Butterscotch chips (optional)</li>
	  </ul>

                  <p>Great intro!  It was a challenge to stir both topics into one bowl but you did it! I agree with Owen about not italicizing (em-ing) all the text in the table and recipe. I do like italicizing the lede though. I wish the OOP part were better explained.  But that would have been a lot of work! You could quote from and link to these (I emailed you PDFs)
			 <br> Tweaks:
                         <br> 1. Sp: incoporate - always a good idea to put your posts into a spellchecker before publishing. 
                         <br> 2. Do not let semicolons sneak into your arguments! whiskMediumBowl(melted-butter, brown-sugar, granulated-sugar; egg, egg-yolk)</p>
